This repository about problem-solving for technical test by Palm Code. The program is separated into backend (Flask Restful Api) and frontend (HTML, JS)

Based on task intruction, develop an appointment booking agent that can have a natural conversation with a human. I've build a backend system used Meena.
Meena's model pretrained that developed by Google and LLM-base. The model's known for its ability to produce more natural and relevant responses in conversations compared to previous language models. Meena's trained using advanced techniques and big data to understand and generate text in human language in a more in-depth way.

How to start ?
1. Build your virtual environment by Python then activate (Currently, python 3.9.6)
2. You should install packages required through typing in your terminals "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Run the program "python index.py"
4. Make sure the program running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 and direct the routing to http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat (POST)
5. Run the index.html using "Open with Live Server" (if you use Visual Studio Code), then the program already use
6. Propose your booking slot in the chatbot with the format that has been presented
